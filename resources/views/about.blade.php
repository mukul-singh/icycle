                The original ICYCLE team was formed in early 2011, made up of rag-tag 
                cyclists who had discovered the joys of cycling. The personal cycling 
                trips were so much fun that other friends also wanted to experience it… 
                and they too fell in love with cycling. Seeing this popularity among 
                family & friends, ICYCLE decided extend this “joy of cycling” to the 
                general public.
